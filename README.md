# Minesweeper Google

## About
Minesweeper Google is a digital version of the classic Minesweeper game, offering a fun and challenging experience. In this game, you clear a grid of tiles by revealing numbers or mines. The numbers represent how many mines are nearby. Your goal is to uncover all non-mined tiles without triggering any mines.
